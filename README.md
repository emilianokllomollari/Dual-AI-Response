# Dual-Response AI Chat Platform

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Dual-Response AI Chat Platform! This platform is designed to providie two AI distinct responses for every user input, utilizing the APIs of both Gemini and GPT-3.5. Built on Flask and SQLite, with a focus on a user-friendly experience. While the core functionality brings diverse perspectives within a single query, thsi platfrom doesn't stop here. I am continuously working to enhance the platform's capabilities and user interface.

## Features

- **Dual AI Integration**: Leverages the power of GeminAI and GPT-3.5 APIs to offer dual responses, enriching user interaction with varied insights.
- **Custom Chat Interface**: Features a bespoke chat interface, providing an intuitive and engaging user experience, complete with authentication for personalized sessions. The chat interface, along with the sign-in and sign-up pages, were built from scratch using Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design.
- **Robust Data Management**: Employs SQLite for efficient and secure management of user data, including accounts, chat histories, and session details.

## Upcoming Enhancements

Our commitment to enhancing the Dual-Response AI Chat Platform is stronger than ever. Here's what we're working on:

- **Enhanced Front-End Design**: A more intuitive and user-focused interface that caters to the needs of our diverse user base. This includes the completion of the contact form and the blog page, which are currently under development.
- **Account Management Features**: Upcoming functionalities for users to reset passwords, change email addresses, and update their profiles effortlessly.
- **AI Memory Integration**: Introducing memory capabilities with LangChain to allow the AI to remember previous interactions, thus personalizing the conversational experience further.
- **Image-Based Prompts**: Expanding the AI's capability to understand and respond to image prompts, adding a new dimension to user interactions.

## Front-End Templates

Portions of the front-end design outside the custom chat interface, sign-in, and sign-up pages were adapted from [Front-End Template Source](#https://themeforest.net/item/openup-ai-content-writing-applications-landing-page-template/46030556). These templates are gonna be customized to fit the requirements of my project.
